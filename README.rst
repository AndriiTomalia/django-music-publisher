Django Music Publisher
*******************************************************************************

This is a simple Django app for original music publishers. The app is released 
under `MIT license <LICENSE>`_ and is basically free. However, it uses a paid
external service for data validation, creation of CWR files and parsing of CWR
acknowledgement files, so using it is *not free*. 15-day demo licence is 
available upon request. Please start 
`here <https://matijakolaric.com/development/cwr-toolset/#demo-and-tool-preview>`_.

It covers just a single use-case:
one original publisher, publishing original musical works.
(Original work is one that is not a modification of existing work.)
Situations with multiple writers are covered, but other publishers are ignored.
This still results in correct registrations.

If you want to use it for exactly this purpose, then just follow the depoyment
instructions below.
