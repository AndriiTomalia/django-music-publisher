Django Music Publisher
*******************************************************************************

This is a simple Django app for original music publishers. The app is released 
under `MIT licence <LICENCE>`_ and is basically free. However, it uses a paid
external service for data validation, creation of CWR files and parsing of CWR
acknowledgement files.

It covers just a single use-case:
one original publisher, publishing original musical works.
(Original work is one that is not a modification of existing work.)
