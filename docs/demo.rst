Demo
===============================================================================

A demo is available with some demo data. There are two versions, the US and the 
World version. The differences are subtle, but crucial. The US demo allows for 
multple entities affiliated with different PROs, while the world version does
not, but features society-assigned agreement numbers. In the demo, they are 
not required, although this is true in some societies and can be changed with a
single setting.

No registration is required to use the demos. For both use the following credentials:

* Username: ``demo``
* Password: ``demo``

And here are the demos:
