Music Publishing for Developers
###############################

This is a very brief introduction to music publishing for software developers. 

Music publishing started with publishing of sheet music, and first music performing rights societies were formed in the mid-1800s, predating recording, telephone and radio. With the invention of recording and techniques, mechanical rights became a thing and some societies decided to cover them as well, while in some countries, new organizations were formed. All of them are called collecting organizations, but in official CWR documentation, they are referred to as societies. The third type are synchronization rights, basically music used for advertising.

Although sheet music is not in the focus any more, composers and lyricists (writers) still have contracts with music publishers. When a (co-)writer has a contract about a musical work with a publisher, this publisher is original publisher of the work in question. Usually 50% of performing and 100% of mechanical and synchronization rights are transferred to the original publishers. Each writer can have a different publisher, or even multiple ones, or not have one at all.

Writers and publishers who are in the chain of agreements that includes the sender of the CWR file are referred to as *controlled*. 

Each original publisher has, among others, a fiduciary obligation to register clientâ€™s shares, when they register their own collecting organizations they are affiliated with.

Royalties for collecting rights are payed, based on registrations. There is a popular belief among writers that by registering in their home societies, other societies will somehow magically know about that. While some collecting organizations share data among themselves, most of them do not.
