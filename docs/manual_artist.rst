   Performing artist list view

``Performing artist list`` view is a simple one, there are no filters, only a search field, and beside the three fields, there are two counters with links, to the :doc:`list of recordings <manual_recordings>` where this artist is a recording artist and to the :doc:`list of works <manual_works_list>`, where this artists performs LIVE (or recording data is not available).

``Add`` and ``change`` views are minimalistic. ``Last name`` (also used for band names) and ``first name`` fields, as well as ``ISNI``, unique artist identifier.
