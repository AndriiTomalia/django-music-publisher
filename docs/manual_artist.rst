Django-Music-Publisher, as a software for primarily music publishers, holds only basic
data about an artist: ``First Name``, ``Last Name`` and ``ISNI``. For bands, the band name 
goes into ``last name`` field.

There are no filters, only a search field. In the table, beside the three fields, 
there are two counters with links, to the :doc:`list of recordings <manual_recordings>` 
by this artist the :doc:`list of works <manual_works_list>` performed by this artist LIVE.
It is also used if the recording data is not available.
