DMP is free open-source software, released under :doc:`MIT license <LICENSE>`. 

There is an optional 
`professional (paid) support service <https://matijakolaric.com/dmp-prosupport/>`_
for DMP users.

While we are commited to keep developing DMP as free software, we can not offer free
support to its growing number of users around the world.

It really has two aspects:

* user support
* technical maintenance

User support
------------------------------

The world of music publishing is extremely complex. And DMP is not simple software.

No matter how good and detailed this documentation is, or how many 
`videos <https://youtube.com/c/musicmetadata>`_ we make,
there are always specific questions that remain unanswered.

They may be strictly related to DMP, or about data formats, or about quirks 
of various collecting societies.

Technical maintenance
---------------------------------

We made the deployment to Heroku extremely simple, requiring no technical skills.
However, keeping it up-to-date is a bit more complicated. 
And online software must be kept up-to-date for security reasons, if not for new features.

This can be done by a junior system administrator or Python/Django developer.
So can installing it on any other platform, including personal computers.

Still, this is not good enough for most small music publishers, as they do not have 
these skills in-house. 

Technical maintenance without user support is also available.
