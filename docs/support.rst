DMP is free open-source software, released under :doc:`MIT license <LICENSE>`. 

The creator of Django-Music-Publisher (DMP) runs a 
`professional (paid) support service <https://matijakolaric.com/dmp-prosupport/>`_
for users of DMP.

It really has two parts:

* technical maintenance
* user support

Technical maintenance
---------------------------------

We made the deployment to Heroku extremely simple, requiring no technical skills.
However, keeping it up-to-date is a bit more complicated. 
And online software must be kept up-to-date for security reasons, if not new features.

It is withing reach of a junior system administrator or Python/Django developer,
just as installing it on any other platform, including personal computers.

Still, this is not good enough for most small music publishers.

User support
------------------------------

A lot of effort was put into keeping it intuitive and seemingly simple, 
while offering many advanced features, e.g. CWR and royalty processing.
But, it is far from being simple.

On the other hand, the environment is really complex.

CWR alone has dozens of very different implementations in various collecting societies. 
Even applying for it is simple in some, while complex in others.
Royalty statements came in many, many different formats.

No matter how good and detailed the documentation is, or how many videos we make,
there are always specific questions that remain unanswered.

Some questions are strictly related to DMP, some about data formats, some about quirks 
of some collecting society.

Quite often, it is just about showing data to an expert before sending it to a society 
or a sub-publisher. Just to make sure that all is well.

Should you use it?
---------------------------

No. Unless...
