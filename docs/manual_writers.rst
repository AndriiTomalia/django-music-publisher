   Writer list view, note how lack of data influences ``can be controlled`` value.

As every musical work requires at least one writer, this makes ``Writer`` views to be a very important one.

``Add`` and ``change`` views have three field groups. ``Last name`` and ``first name`` fields in the first, ``IPI name #``, ``IPI Base #`` and ``Performance Rights Society`` in the second, all quite obvious.

In the third, we have three fields:

* ``General agreement`` checkbox to mark that there is an original general agreement with this writer. This means that this writer must be controlled in all works.
* ``Society-assigned agreement number`` for the original general agreement between you and this writer (required in some societies)
* ``Publisher fee`` is the fee kept by the publisher when royalties are paid and distributed. **This field is not used in registrations.** It is used only for royalty statement processing. Most small publishers don't use it.

``Writer list`` view filters and most of the columns in the table are self-explanatory. ``Can be controlled`` may not be. There is a minimal set of data for controlled writers. This field shows if provided data fulfills the criteria.

The last column is a counter and link to the :doc:`list of works <manual_works_list>` by this writer.
