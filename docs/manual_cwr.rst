Creating CWR Export
===================

   Add CWR export view

There are several ways to get to ``Add CWR Export`` view:

* from the ``home`` page or app menu or ``CWR Export list`` view by pressing on ``Add CWR Export`` button or
* from the ``Create CWR from selected works`` batch action in ``Work list`` view.

Please note that the field ``Works`` uses auto-complete, and if you don't come here through the action, you must add works in this view one at a time.

``CWR version/type`` field selects the CWR version and transaction type. CWR 2.1 makes a distinction between ``New Work Registrations`` and ``Revisions``, while CWR 3.0 (not yet in use anywhere) has no such distinction.

``Internal note`` is what the name says, you can enter whatever helps you to keep track. It can even be edited from the ``list`` view.

   CWR export list view

Upon save, you will be taken to the ``CWR export list view``. It has two links in each row: ``View CWR`` and ``Download``. The latter will download the CWR file, and the former will take you to the preview:

   CWR preview with syntax highlighting

The example shown above shows the CWR file with syntax highlighting. When you hover over the fields with your cursor, additional information is shown to help in solving issues with your society or any other receiver of the CWR file.  This feature is not available in open source code.
