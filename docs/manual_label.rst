Label model only has a single field: ``name``.

However, the list views have counters with links:

* for :doc:`recordings <manual_recording>`, where this label was the ``record label``,
* for :doc:`library releases <manual_libraryrelease>`,  where this label is the ``release (album) label``,
* for :doc:`commercial releases <manual_commercialrelease>`, where this label is the ``release (album) label``.
