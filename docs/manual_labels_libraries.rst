   Librariy list view, note the counters for releases and works with links

Labels and libraries are extremely simple, these models only have a single field: ``name``.

However, the list views have counters with links:

* ``Labels`` has counters for :doc:`recordings <manual_recordings>` as well as :doc:`commercial and library releases <manual_releases>` and
* ``Library`` has counters for :doc:`library releases <manual_releases>` and :doc:`works <manual_works_list>`.
