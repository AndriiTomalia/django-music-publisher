Django-Music-Publisher (DMP) is open source software for **managing music metadata**,
(works, writers, recordings, artists, labels, releases and libraries).
It uses
`Common Works Registration (CWR) <https://matijakolaric.com/articles/1/>`_
for batch registration/licencing of musical works with collective management organizations (CMOs, AKA PROs, MROs,
collecting societies, etc.) and DSPs, as well as data delivery to sub-publishers.
