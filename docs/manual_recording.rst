   Recording list view, note the use of search and filters

``Recording list`` view provides a nice overview, with it's search and filter capabilities and links for the :doc:`work <manual_works>`, :doc:`recording artist <manual_artists>` and :doc:`record label <manual_labels_libraries>`.

``Add recording`` and ``Change recording`` views are currently redundant. Users are discouraged to use them. Recordings can be edited through :doc:`works <manual_works>`, and tracks can be edited through :doc:`releases <manual_releases>`.

Compared to the ``Recordings`` section in ``Works``, there is only one additional field at the top, where the work can be chosen or added through a popup,
and a ``Tracks`` section at the bottom, connecting a recording with a :doc:`release <manual_releases>`.

Note that a ``Work`` popup holds only a subset of fields compared to the normal view. The data that is not visible will **not** be lost when saving through popup.


Recording title
---------------

There are three fields in this row. ``Recording title`` is where one enters the title of the recording. If ``recording title suffix`` is checked, then the former field is used as a suffix to the ``work title``. This is a huge benefit in production music, where there are multiple recordings per work, usually with same suffixes, e.g. "drums", "bed", etc. The result is then shown in the ``complete recording title`` field.

Version title
-------------

Same is valid for the ``version title``, except that the suffix is added to the ``recording title``.

Other fields
------------

``ISRC`` is a unique identifier, issued by record labels. ``Recording artist``, ``record label``, ``duration`` and ``release date`` are quite obvious.

Note that after a successful save, there is a ``change`` link in the recording header.
